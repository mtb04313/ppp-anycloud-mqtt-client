# ppp-anycloud-mqtt-client

This code example demonstrates implementing an PPP / Wi-Fi / MQTT client. It runs on FreeRTOS only -- RTThread support has been removed.

The PPP client uses the [Lightweight IP library](https://git.savannah.nongnu.org/git/lwip/#STABLE-2_1_2_RELEASE#$$ASSET_REPO$$/lwip/STABLE-2_1_2_RELEASE). The project `Makefile` specifies LwIP PPP related files to add to the `SOURCE` list.

Supporting libraries include:
- [PPP-connection-manager](https://github.com/mtb04313/ppp-connection-manager)
- [Uicc-atmodem](https://github.com/mtb04313/uicc-atmodem)
- [Uicc-common](https://github.com/mtb04313/uicc-common)
- [ATmodem](https://github.com/mtb04313/atmodem)
- [Platform-utilities](https://github.com/mtb04313/platform-utilities)

The MQTT client uses the [MQTT library](https://github.com/Infineon/mqtt). The library uses the AWS IoT device SDK Port library and implements the glue layer that is required for the library to work with Infineon connectivity platforms.

In this example, the MQTT client RTOS task establishes a connection with the configured MQTT broker, and creates two tasks: publisher and subscriber. The publisher task publishes messages on a topic when the user button is pressed on the kit. The subscriber task subscribes to the same topic and controls the user LED based on the messages received from the MQTT broker. In case of unexpected disconnection of MQTT, PPP or Wi-Fi connection, the application executes a reconnection mechanism to restore the connection. This example can be ported to the CM0+ core using a make variable `CORE` from Makefile.

**Sequence of operation**

1. The user button is pressed.

2. The GPIO interrupt service routine (ISR) notifies the publisher task.

3. The publisher task publishes a message on a topic.

4. The MQTT broker sends back the message to the MQTT client because it is also subscribed to the same topic.

5. When the message is received, the subscriber task turns the LED ON or OFF. As a result, the user LED toggles every time the user presses the button.

**Note:** The PSoC&trade; 6 Wi-Fi Bluetooth&reg; pioneer kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) ships with KitProg2 installed. The ModusToolbox&trade; software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

## Software setup

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

This code example implements a generic MQTT client that can connect to various MQTT brokers. In this document, the instructions to set up and run the MQTT client have been provided for the AWS IoT and Mosquitto MQTT brokers for reference. If you are using this code example with Mosquitto broker running locally on your PC, you need to download and install Mosquitto broker from https://mosquitto.org/download.

This example does not require additional software or tools if you are using the MQTT client with a publicly hosted MQTT broker.


## Using the code example
In a command-line Terminal:

1. clone the project
   - git clone https://github.com/mtb04313/ppp-anycloud-mqtt-client.git

2. set the branch to `branch_v0.3.0_for_mtb_3_0`
   - cd ppp-anycloud-mqtt-client
   - git checkout branch_v0.3.0_for_mtb_3_0

3. download dependencies
   - make getlibs

4. (optional) compile
   - make build

5. (optional) run Modus Toolbox 3.0 and choose `Import Application in-place`


## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. (Optional) Run Modus Toolbox Library Manager to switch to another BSP / board.

3. Modify the user configuration files in the *configs* directory as follows:

      1. **AT modem configuration:** Choose a cellular modem in *configs/atmodem_config.h*: Set the macro `ATMODEM_HW` to match the modem hardware and verify the pins used by the board. 

      2. **Feature configuration:** Choose the features to enable or disable in *configs/feature_config.h*: Set the respective `FEATURE_` macro to either `ENABLE_FEATURE` or `DISABLE_FEATURE`.

      3. **PPP configuration:** Set the PPP credentials in *configs/ppp_config.h*, such as the `PPP_APN`.  
         
      4. **Wi-Fi configuration:** Set the Wi-Fi credentials in *configs/wifi_config.h*, such as the `WIFI_SSID` and `WIFI_PASSWORD`.

      5. **MQTT configuration:** Set up the MQTT client and configure the credentials in *configs/mqtt_client_config.h*. Some of the important configuration macros are as follows:

         - `MQTT_BROKER_ADDRESS`: Hostname of the MQTT broker

         - `MQTT_PORT`: Port number to be used for the MQTT connection. As specified by IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority), port numbers assigned for MQTT protocol are *1883* for non-secure connections and *8883* for secure connections. However, MQTT brokers may use other ports. Configure this macro as specified by the MQTT broker.

         - `MQTT_SECURE_CONNECTION`: Set this macro to `1` if a secure (TLS) connection to the MQTT broker is required to be established; else `0`.

         - `MQTT_USERNAME` and `MQTT_PASSWORD`: User name and password for client authentication and authorization, if required by the MQTT broker. However, note that this information is generally not encrypted and the password is sent in plain text. Therefore, this is not a recommended method of client authentication.

         - `CLIENT_CERTIFICATE` and `CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY`: Certificate and private key of the MQTT client used for client authentication. Note that these macros are applicable only when `MQTT_SECURE_CONNECTION` is set to `1`.

         - `ROOT_CA_CERTIFICATE`: Root CA certificate of the MQTT broker

         See [Setting up the MQTT broker](#setting-up-the-mqtt-broker) to learn how to configure these macros for AWS IoT and Mosquitto MQTT brokers.

         For a full list of configuration macros used in this code example, see [Wi-Fi and MQTT configuration macros](#wi-fi-and-mqtt-configuration-macros).

      6. Other configuration files: You can optionally modify the configuration macros in the following files according to your application:

         - *configs/lwipopts.h* used by the [LwIP library](https://git.savannah.nongnu.org/git/lwip/#STABLE-2_1_2_RELEASE#$$ASSET_REPO$$/lwip/STABLE-2_1_2_RELEASE).

         - *configs/mbedtls_user_config.h* used by the [Mbed-TLS library](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls).

         - *configs/core_mqtt_config.h* used by the [MQTT library](https://github.com/Infineon/mqtt).

         - *configs/COMPONENT_(CORE)/FreeRTOSConfig.h* used by the [FreeRTOS library](https://github.com/Infineon/freertos). here, `CORE` value can be **CM4** or **CM0P** only.

3. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

4. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application for default core using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain and default core values are specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain> CORE=<core>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM CORE=CM4
      ```
   </details>

5. After programming, the application starts automatically. Observe the messages on the UART terminal, and wait for the device to make all the required connections.

   **Figure 1. Application initialization status**

   ![](images/ppp_application_initialization.png)

6. Once the initialization is complete, confirm that the message *"Press the user button (SW2) to publish "TURN ON"/"TURN OFF" on the topic 'ledstatus'..."* is printed on the UART terminal. This message may vary depending on the MQTT topic and publish messages that are configured in the *mqtt_client_config.h* file.

7. Press the user button (SW2) on the kit to toggle the LED state.

8. Confirm that the user LED state is toggled and the messages received on the subscribed topic are printed on the UART terminal.

   **Figure 2. Publisher and subscriber logs**

   ![](images/ppp_publish_subscribe_messages.png)

This example can be programmed on multiple kits (*only when `GENERATE_UNIQUE_CLIENT_ID` is set to `1`*); the user LEDs on all the kits will synchronously toggle with button presses on any kit.

Alternatively, the publish and subscribe functionalities of the MQTT client can be individually verified if the MQTT broker supports a test MQTT client like the AWS IoT.

- *To verify the subscribe functionality*: Using the test MQTT client, publish messages such as "TURN ON" and "TURN OFF" on the topic specified by the `MQTT_PUB_TOPIC` macro in *mqtt_client_config.h* to control the LED state on the kit.

- *To verify the publish functionality*: From the Test MQTT client, subscribe to the MQTT topic specified by the `MQTT_SUB_TOPIC` macro and confirm that the messages published by the kit (when the user button is pressed) are displayed on the test MQTT client's console.


## Debugging


You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-Eclipse_IDE_for_ModusToolbox_User_Guide_1-UserManual-v01_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d718a49017d99bcb86331e8).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice â once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/t5/Knowledge-Base-Articles/PSoC-6-MCU-Code-in-main-executes-before-the-debugger-halts-at-the-first-line-of/ta-p/253856) to learn about this and for the workaround.


## Design and implementation

This example implements three RTOS tasks: MQTT client, publisher, and subscriber. The main function initializes the BSP and the retarget-io library, and creates the MQTT client task.

The MQTT client task initializes the Wi-Fi connection manager (WCM) and connects to a Wi-Fi access point (AP) using the Wi-Fi network credentials that are configured in *wifi_config.h*. Upon a successful Wi-Fi connection, the task initializes the MQTT library and establishes a connection with the MQTT broker/server.

The MQTT connection is configured to be secure by default; the secure connection requires a client certificate, a private key, and the Root CA certificate of the MQTT broker that are configured in *mqtt_client_config.h*.

After a successful MQTT connection, the subscriber and publisher tasks are created. The MQTT client task then waits for commands from the other two tasks and callbacks to handle events like unexpected disconnections.

The subscriber task initializes the user LED GPIO and subscribes to messages on the topic specified by the `MQTT_SUB_TOPIC` macro that can be configured in *mqtt_client_config.h*. When the subscriber task receives a message from the broker, it turns the user LED ON or OFF depending on whether the received message is "TURN ON" or "TURN OFF" (configured using the `MQTT_DEVICE_ON_MESSAGE` and `MQTT_DEVICE_OFF_MESSAGE` macros).

The publisher task sets up the user button GPIO and configures an interrupt for the button. The ISR notifies the Publisher task upon a button press. The publisher task then publishes messages (*TURN ON* / *TURN OFF*) on the topic specified by the `MQTT_PUB_TOPIC` macro. When the publish operation fails, a message is sent over a queue to the MQTT client task.

An MQTT event callback function `mqtt_event_callback()` invoked by the MQTT library for events like MQTT disconnection and incoming MQTT subscription messages from the MQTT broker. In the case of an MQTT disconnection, the MQTT client task is informed about the disconnection using a message queue. When an MQTT subscription message is received, the subscriber callback function implemented in *subscriber_task.c* is invoked to handle the incoming MQTT message.

The MQTT client task handles unexpected disconnections in the MQTT or Wi-Fi connections by initiating reconnection to restore the Wi-Fi and/or MQTT connections. Upon failure, the publisher and subscriber tasks are deleted, cleanup operations of various libraries are performed, and then the MQTT client task is terminated.

**Note:** The CY8CPROTO-062-4343W board shares the same GPIO for the user button (USER BTN) and the CYW4343W host wakeup pin. Because this example uses the GPIO for interfacing with the user button to toggle the LED, the SDIO interrupt to wake up the host is disabled by setting `CY_WIFI_HOST_WAKE_SW_FORCE` to '0' in the Makefile through the `DEFINES` variable.

Note that this is an optional macro for most of the use cases. <br>Per IANA, the port numbers assigned for MQTT protocol are 1883 for non-secure connections and 8883 for secure connections. In some cases, there is a need to use other ports for MQTT like port 443 (which is reserved for HTTPS). ALPN is an extension to TLS that allows many protocols to be used over a secure connection.
 `MQTT_SNI_HOSTNAME`   | The server name indication (SNI) host name to be used during the transport layer security (TLS) connection as specified by the MQTT broker. <br>SNI is extension to the TLS protocol. As required by some MQTT brokers, SNI typically includes the hostname in the "Client Hello" message sent during TLS handshake.
 `MQTT_NETWORK_BUFFER_SIZE`   | A network buffer is allocated for sending and receiving MQTT packets over the network. Specify the size of this buffer using this macro. Note that the minimum buffer size is defined by the `CY_MQTT_MIN_NETWORK_BUFFER_SIZE` macro in the MQTT library.

#### Setting up the MQTT broker

<details><summary><b>AWS IoT MQTT</b></summary>

 1. Set up the MQTT device (also known as a *Thing*) in the AWS IoT core as described in the [Getting started with AWS IoT tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-gs.html).

    **Note:** While setting up your device, ensure that the policy associated with this device permits all MQTT operations (*iot:Connect*, *iot:Publish*, *iot:Receive*, and *iot:Subscribe*) for the resource used by this device. For testing purposes, it is recommended to have the following policy document which allows all *MQTT Policy Actions* on all *Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)*.
    ```
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": "iot:*",
                "Resource": "*"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

 2. In the *configs/mqtt_client_config.h* file, set `MQTT_BROKER_ADDRESS` to your custom endpoint on the **Settings** page of the AWS IoT console. This has the format `ABCDEFG1234567.iot.<region>.amazonaws.com`.

 3. Set the macros `MQTT_PORT` to `8883` and `MQTT_SECURE_CONNECTION` to `1` in the *configs/mqtt_client_config.h* file.

 4. Download the following certificates and keys that are created and activated in the previous step:

       - A certificate for the AWS IoT Thing - *xxxxxxxxxx.cert.pem*
       - A public key - *xxxxxxxxxx.public.key*
       - A private key - *xxxxxxxxxx.private.key*
       - Root CA "RSA 2048 bit key: Amazon Root CA 1" for AWS IoT from [CA certificates for server authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/server-authentication.html#server-authentication-certs).

 5. Using these certificates and keys, enter the following parameters in *mqtt_client_config.h* in Privacy-Enhanced Mail (PEM) format:
       - `CLIENT_CERTIFICATE` - *xxxxxxxxxx.cert.pem*
       - `CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY` - *xxxxxxxxxx.private.key*
       - `ROOT_CA_CERTIFICATE` - Root CA certificate

    You can either convert the values to strings manually following the format shown in *mqtt_client_config.h* or you can use the HTML utility available [here](https://github.com/Infineon/amazon-freertos/blob/master/tools/certificate_configuration/PEMfileToCString.html) to convert the certificates and keys from PEM format to C string format. You need to clone the repository from GitHub to use the utility.

<details><summary><b>Local Mosquitto broker</b></summary>

Download and install the Mosquitto broker for your PC from https://mosquitto.org/download. The following instructions help in setting up the Mosquitto broker for a secure connection with the client using self-signed SSL certificates. This requires **OpenSSL** which is already preloaded in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation. Run the following commands with a CLI (on Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of the standard Windows command-line application).

1. Generate the CA certificate for the Mosquitto broker / server using the following commands. Follow the instructions in the command window to provide the details required.
   ```
   openssl genrsa -out ca.key 2048
   openssl req -new -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -key ca.key -out ca.crt
   ```

2. Generate the server key pair and server certificate (signed using the CA certificate from Step 1) for the Mosquitto broker using the following commands. Follow the instructions in the command window to provide the details required.
   ```
   openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048
   openssl req -new -nodes -sha256 -key server.key -out server.csr
   openssl x509 -req -sha256 -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out server.crt -days 365
   ```

   At this stage, the certificates and keys required by the Mosquitto broker are ready. The files used from these steps are *ca.crt*, *server.crt*, and *server.key*.

3. Create a configuration file for the Mosquitto Broker - *mosquitto.conf* with the following contents and provide the path to the generated credentials (*ca.crt*, *server.crt*, and *server.key*) under the *SSL settings* section.
    ```
   # Config file for mosquitto
   connection_messages true
   per_listener_settings true
   listener 8883
   require_certificate true
   use_identity_as_username true
   allow_anonymous false
   cafile <path-to-ca.crt>
   keyfile <path-to-server.key>
   certfile <path-to-server.crt>
   ```

4. Start the Mosquitto broker with the configurations from the above *mosquitto.conf* file using the following command. If the *mosquitto.conf* file is present in a different location from where the command is run, provide the path to the config file after the `-c` argument.
   ```
   mosquitto -v -c mosquitto.conf
   ```

5. Generate the client certificates using the following commands. Follow the instructions in the command window to provide the details required. Note that the last command requires *ca.crt* and *ca.key* files generated in Step 2.
   ```
   openssl genrsa -out client.key 2048
   openssl req -new -out client.csr -key client.key
   openssl x509 -req -in client.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out client.crt -days 365
   ```

6. Configure the MQTT client configurations in *configs/mqtt_client_config.h* as follows:

     - `MQTT_BROKER_ADDRESS` as the IP address of the PC running the Mosquitto broker (the PC on which Step 4 is performed).

     - `MQTT_PORT` as `8883`.

     - `MQTT_SECURE_CONNECTION` as `1`.

     - Using the client certificate (*client.crt*), private key (*client.key*), and root CA certificate (*ca.crt*) from the above steps, configure the `CLIENT_CERTIFICATE`, `CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY`, and `ROOT_CA_CERTIFICATE` macros respectively.

       You can either convert the PEM format values to strings manually following the format shown in *mqtt_client_config.h* or you can use the HTML utility available [here](https://github.com/Infineon/amazon-freertos/blob/master/tools/certificate_configuration/PEMfileToCString.html) to convert the certificates and keys from PEM format to C string format. You need to clone the repository from GitHub to use the utility.

</details>

Although this section provides instructions only for AWS IoT and the local Mosquitto broker, the MQTT client implemented in this example is generic. It is expected to work with other MQTT brokers with appropriate configurations. See the [list of publicly-accessible MQTT brokers](https://github.com/mqtt/mqtt.github.io/wiki/public_brokers) that can be used for testing and prototyping purposes.
